# Specification Quality Checklist: Enhanced Stale PR Board UI with Korean Language Support

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All quality criteria met

**Review Date**: 2025-10-31

**Key Findings**:
- Specification successfully focuses on user outcomes and business value
- All 16 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- 3 prioritized user stories (P1: Block Kit visual enhancement, P2: Korean language support, P3: Language configuration) cover all primary flows
- 8 success criteria provide measurable outcomes without implementation details
- 7 edge cases identified for robust feature coverage
- Dependencies and assumptions clearly documented
- No clarification markers - specification is complete and ready for planning

**Notes**:
- Specification is ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan`
- Block Kit is mentioned as the platform requirement (per user's explicit request) but specific API components are described as outcomes rather than implementation details
