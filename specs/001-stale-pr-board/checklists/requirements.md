## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All checklist items completed

### Content Quality Review

✅ **No implementation details**: The specification focuses on what the system must do (fetch PRs, calculate staleness, send notifications) without prescribing how it should be implemented. No mentions of specific programming languages, frameworks, or technical architectures.

✅ **User value focus**: Every section is written from the perspective of the development team's needs - helping them identify and prioritize stale PRs to improve code review response times.

✅ **Non-technical stakeholder friendly**: The user stories use plain language describing team workflows. Technical concepts (GitHub API, Slack webhook) are mentioned only in assumptions where necessary for understanding, not in core requirements.

✅ **All mandatory sections completed**: User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements (Functional Requirements + Key Entities), and Success Criteria are all present and fully populated.

### Requirement Completeness Review

✅ **No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers**: All potential ambiguities were resolved through user clarification questions before spec writing. The spec contains no unresolved questions.

✅ **Requirements are testable and unambiguous**: Each functional requirement (FR-001 through FR-035) specifies a concrete capability that can be verified through testing. Examples:
- FR-013 defines exact staleness calculation formula
- FR-012 specifies exclusion criteria (PRs with sufficient approval)
- FR-008 defines precise filtering logic (team member is author OR requested reviewer)

✅ **Success criteria are measurable**: All 8 success criteria include specific metrics:
- SC-001: "within 2 minutes for organizations with up to 50 repositories"
- SC-002: "less than 1 hour margin of error"
- SC-003: "100% accuracy in filtering"
- SC-005: "improves by at least 30%"

✅ **Success criteria are technology-agnostic**: Success criteria describe user-facing outcomes (execution time, accuracy, team response time improvement) without referencing technical implementation. No mentions of specific APIs, databases, or frameworks.

✅ **All acceptance scenarios defined**: Each user story (P1, P2, P3) includes multiple Given/When/Then acceptance scenarios:
- P1: 8 acceptance scenarios covering core functionality
- P2: 5 acceptance scenarios covering enhanced UI
- P3: 3 acceptance scenarios covering configurable scoring

✅ **Edge cases identified**: 10 edge cases documented covering API rate limits, access control, configuration errors, and complex approval scenarios.

✅ **Scope clearly bounded**: The spec defines three distinct priority levels (P1 MVP, P2 enhanced UI, P3 configurable scoring) with clear boundaries between them. P1 is deliberately kept simple (manual execution, basic Slack formatting) to fit 3-5 day implementation cycle per constitution.

✅ **Dependencies and assumptions identified**: 12 detailed assumptions documented in the Assumptions section covering execution model, authentication, integration methods, and default behaviors.

### Feature Readiness Review

✅ **Functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria**: All 35 functional requirements are mapped to acceptance scenarios in the user stories. Each requirement specifies the exact capability needed.

✅ **User scenarios cover primary flows**: P1 covers the core flow (fetch PRs → filter by team → calculate staleness → sort → notify via Slack). P2 and P3 extend this with progressive enhancements.

✅ **Feature meets measurable outcomes**: The success criteria (SC-001 through SC-008) define how the feature's value will be measured, including both technical metrics (execution time, accuracy) and business outcomes (improved code review response time).

✅ **No implementation details leak**: The specification maintains clear separation between requirements (what) and implementation (how). Even technical terms like "GitHub API" appear only in assumptions/context, not in functional requirements which remain technology-agnostic where possible.

## Constitution Compliance Check

The specification adheres to the Review-Ops Constitution:

✅ **Simplicity First**: P1 MVP uses the simplest possible approach - manual CLI execution, config file with username list, basic Slack message formatting. More complex features (rich UI, custom scoring) are deferred to P2/P3.

✅ **Small Scope**: P1 is designed to fit within a 3-5 day implementation cycle as a single independently testable slice. The 8 acceptance scenarios for P1 are achievable within this timeframe without requiring complex abstractions.

✅ **Test-Driven Quality**: All functional requirements are directly testable through the defined acceptance scenarios. The spec supports TDD implementation with clear Given/When/Then scenarios that can be turned into tests before writing production code.

## Recommendations

The specification is ready for the next phase:
- **Option A**: Run `/speckit.clarify` if you want to identify any remaining underspecified areas through targeted clarification questions
- **Option B**: Run `/speckit.plan` to proceed directly to implementation planning

Given that all clarification questions were resolved during spec creation and the checklist shows 100% completion, **proceeding directly to `/speckit.plan` is recommended**.

## Notes

- All user clarifications were incorporated during spec creation:
  - Team member definition: Manually configured list (Q1: A)
  - Repository scope: All repos in GitHub organization (Q2: B)
  - Staleness calculation: Time since ready-for-review OR approval-lost (Q3: C)
  - Approval criteria: Respects per-repository settings via GitHub API
  - Approval loss handling: Resets staleness timer
  - Filter behavior: Only show PRs currently lacking approval (Option A)

- The spec follows best practices for TDD-ready requirements with comprehensive acceptance scenarios that can be directly translated into test cases.
